NAME
    local::lib::deps - Maintain a module specific lib path for that modules
    dependencies.

DESCRIPTION
    Maintaining perl module dependencies through a distributions package
    manager can be a real pain. This module helps by making it easier to
    simply bundle all your applications dependencies into one lib path
    specific to the module. It also makes it easy to tell your applicatin
    where to look for modules.

SYNOPSYS
    Bootstrap your modules dependency area:

        use local::lib::deps '-import'; #import the public functions instead of bringing in a modules path.
        install_deps( 'My::Module', qw/Dep::One Dep::Two .../ );

    This will create a directory specifically for the My::Module namespace
    and install the specified dependencies (and local::lib) there.

    To use those deps in your app:

        use local::lib::deps qw/ My::Module /;
        use Dep::One;

    To initiate local::lib with the destination directory of your module:

        use local::lib::deps -locallib 'My::Module';

PUBLIC FUNCTIONS
    To bring these in to your program do this:

        use local::lib::deps -import;

    locallib( $module )
        Will get local::lib setup against the local::lib::deps dir for the
        specified module.

    install_deps( $module, @deps )
        This will bootstrap local::lib into a local::lib::deps folder for
        the specified module, it will then continue to install (or update)
        allt he dependency modules.
